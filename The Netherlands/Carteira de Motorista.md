# Carteira de Motorista

## Trocando sua carteira BR por uma Dutch

- Go to https://www.cbr.nl/en/mijncbr/logon.htm and fill in an online medical form, you will pay around 35 euros now.
- Around 3/4 days latter you will receive a letter with your medical approval.
**Nota:** Eu fiquei esperando uma carta, mas na verdade o certificado sai no próprio site da CBR (você loga e baixa o PDF). Para mim, saiu no mesmo dia.
- Go to stadhuis between 10am-3pm without reservation and take the following docs:
  - Driving license from your country (must be issued more than 6 months ago)
  - 30 % rulling letter
  - 1 Photo that you can take in front of Stadhuis
  - Letter of medical approval you received
  - Residence Permit
  - You will pay with card around 35 euros
