## Post do Guilherme

Informação provida por [Guilherme de Souza Araujo no Slack](https://app.slack.com/team/UHM06G5G8) (acho que o pessoal do time de relocation da empresa dele mandou para ele). As notas são da mensagem dele.

- [VERRA Real Estate](https://www.verrarealestate.com/en/): I worked with them several times, I can recommend them. They also do skype viewings! No agency fee here
- [Domica](https://domica.nl/index.php)
- [Ben Housing](https://www.rotterdamexpat.com/our-properties/)
- [Interhouse](https://interhouse.nl/huurwoningen/?number_of_results=20&sort=date-desc&display=list&paging=1) ( no agency fee)
- [Rotterdam Apartments](https://rotterdamapartments.com/en/Rental-apartments?page=1) (agency fee between €300 and €400, the exact price depends on your rental price)
- [Riva Rentals](https://www.rivarentals.com/) (agency fee e400)
- [123Wonen](https://www.expatrentalsholland.com/offer/in/rotterdam) (I can also recommend them - they ask for a €250 down-payment of the deposit to sort of reserve an apartment, but then they deduct it from the deposit so, after all, they don't charge extra fees)
- [Rotsvast](https://www.rotsvast.nl/en/property-listings/)
- [Rent an Apartment](https://www.rentanapartment.nl/en-gb/) (even though they have a nice and helpful team, they do charge administration costs, around €300 - but yeah, still cheaper than a housing package :smile: they also charge €500 reservation fee that is deducted from your first rent if you are chosen as the new tenant. if you are not chosen, you get the money back. if you cancel the offer, you lose this money)
- [Portsville](http://www.portsville.com/properties) (no agency fee)
- [Kolpa](https://www.kolpa.nl/en/our-properties/rental-properties) (no agency fee)
- [Ooms](https://ooms.com/wonen/aanbod?sort-by=&virtuele-tour=&place=&min_price=0&max_price=0&huur=huur&min_number_of_rooms=&max_number_of_rooms=&min_volume=&max_volume=)
- [Perfectrent](https://www.perfectrent.nl/nl/home) (no agency fee)
